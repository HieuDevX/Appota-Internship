1. http-server.js: create a http server listening at port 8081 by module http of node_modules

2. express-server.js: create the most basic express server listening at port 3000, just can send "Hello world" to the client

3. server.js: create a set of simplified RESTful APIs by express, CRUD APIs don't query database, just send data from a json file without http status code or serious message to the client
